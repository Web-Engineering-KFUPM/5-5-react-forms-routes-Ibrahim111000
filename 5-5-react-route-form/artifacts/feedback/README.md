## How marks were deducted (rules)

- JS/JSX comments are ignored (so starter TODO comments do NOT count).
- Checks are intentionally light: they look for key constructs and basic structure.
- Code can be in ANY order; repeated code is allowed.
- Common equivalents are accepted, and naming is flexible.
- Missing required items reduce marks proportionally within that TODO.
